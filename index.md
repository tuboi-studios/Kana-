This app has the main goal teaching interested people in learn Japanese language, who doesn't have any knowledge about the Hiragana and Katakana alphabet. The app divides in two parts:
- for who doesn't have any knowledge showing a overview about the alphabets,
- and write training, whose function is to write the Hiragana or Katakana syllables of words shown by images of a word, thus making one associate the Japanese word directly with the image.
